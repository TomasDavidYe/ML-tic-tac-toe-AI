# ML-tic-tac-toe-AI
In this project we apply logistic regression and train a Model to effectively play standard Tic Tac Toe. So far plain logistic regression
seems not to be getting the job done so the next step is to implement the training via Neural Networks.
The project is coded in plain Java. No Machine Learning framework is yet used. This is just a practice project
